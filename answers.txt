# Part 1: SDG Selection and Problem Definition

**SDG selection: SDG4: Quality Education** 
**Problem statement**
Problem 1 - Enrollment and Access:
In many rural areas, the enrollment rate for secondary education is
 significantly lower than in urban areas. This disparity can be attributed to 
 several factors such as financial constraints, lack of transportation, inadequate infrastructure, 
 and insufficient leadership in addressing education challenges.
